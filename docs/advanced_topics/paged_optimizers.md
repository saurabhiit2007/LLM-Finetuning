## ðŸ“¦ 5. Paged Optimizers

### Overview

Paged optimizers are designed to manage memory more efficiently during training by dynamically moving optimizer states between CPU and GPU memory. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large models that exceed GPU memory capacity.

### Mechanism

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Optimizer states are stored in CPU memory and paged into GPU memory as needed.
- **Efficient Data Transfer**: Minimizes data transfer overhead by batching optimizer state updates.

### Advantages

- **Reduced GPU Memory Usage**: Allows training of larger models on GPUs with limited memory.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling to models with billions of parameters.
